# Write a Python program to demonstrate the creation of variables and different data types.
# Practical Example 1: How does the Python code structure work?
"""
Python code typically starts at the top and executes sequentially.
Indentation is crucial for defining blocks of code (like loops and if statements).
"""
# Practical Example 2: How to create variables in Python?

name = "Parth" # it's string veriable
age = 30 # it's int veriable
height = 5.9 # it's float veriable
is_student = False # it's boolean veriable

print ("Name : ",name)
print ("Age : ",age)
print ("Height : ",height)
print ("Is Student ? ",is_student)

# Practical Example 3: How to take user input using the input() function.

number = input("enter the number = ")

# Practical Example 4: How to check the type of a variable dynamically using type().

print ("the type of input nuber :",type(number))
